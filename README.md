Distributed File System with Fault Tolerance and Encryption

## Description
A scalable and secure distributed file system that ensures reliable storage through fault tolerance, role-based access control, and data encryption. I have done this project as part of my masters project for Distributed Systems.
This Project is just a basic DFS with minimum features, this can be developed further.

## Features
- Fault tolerance through data replication.
- Secure encryption for file storage and retrieval.
- Role-based access control for user security.
- Scalable architecture suitable for distributed environments.
